It is a common industry practice to use Private IP addresses in the enterprise network. Different locations of the same enterprise may use the same IP address ranges if they use distinct networks. Different enterprises often use the same IP ranges within their own enterprise networks. During merging of different locations within the same enterprise or different enterprises, conflicts may be detected making routing inefficient thereby creating a need for them to be resolved. Furthermore, consolidation of the subnets needs to be done to minimize the size of the resultant routing tables, thereby making routing efficient. The two problems are NP-hard and the proposed method employs specific algorithms and heuristics to solve them. Following the proposed method, the number of routing table entries is shown to get minimized by 80-90% by changing only 3-4% of the subnet addresses.
